Serenus Coin is a stable coin system. It issues a crytocurrency that
retains a stable value with respect to the US dollar by holding
ethereum as crypto-collateral. Issuers take on the risk of holding
ethereum for a small fee. Users receive a dollar-equivalent value of
serenus. It is available to anyone at any time as a store of value or
medium of exchange on the ethereum mainnet.

The smart contract system that Serenus Coin is built on provides
extremely good prices for swapping between ether and dollar-stable
serenus. The bid/offer spreads are far better than on other
decentralised exchanges and commissions are comparable to centralised
exchanges. Note that this is a specialised exchange: you can only swap
between ether and serenus and back again. See the `white paper
<https://serenuscoin.com/assets/files/serenuscoinwhitepaper.pdf>`_ for
more details.
